            <p>Legal Compliance of Our Hemp Products

All our hemp products comply with the 2018 Farm Bill and applicable state laws. They contain less than 0.3% Delta-9 THC on a dry weight basis, making them federally legal in the United States.

We source our hemp from licensed growers and conduct rigorous testing on all products to ensure quality and compliance with federal standards. Certificates of Analysis (COAs) are available for every product, providing transparency about their cannabinoid content.

Important Notice:

It is your responsibility to understand the laws in your state or jurisdiction. By purchasing from this website, you confirm that you are at least 18 years old (or 21 in applicable states) and that hemp-derived products are legal in your area.
Our products are not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.
Keep out of reach of children.
If you have questions about the legality of our products, feel free to contact us. We are here to provide clarity and ensure your peace of mind.</p>
